This archive contains the examples used in the Second Edition of O'Reilly and
Associates' Essential SNMP. Each directory name corresponds to a chapter in
the book that contained examples. Please note the following.

ch11/ contains mostly Perl scripts. As such, you will need to have
Perl installed on your system. Please go to http://www.perl.com for more
information.

ch14/ contains Java source code. Included is a Makefile for building the 
source. Also included are Unix shell scripts from running each sample
application. In order to run and complile the examples you will
need to obtain the SNMP4J library from http://www.snmp4j.org. Once you
download the ZIP file, you can find SNMP4J.jar in snmp4j/dist/lib/. You may
also need the log4j library as well. SNMP4J comes with a copy of this library
and its location in the ZIP is snmp4j/lib/. Finally, you may need to edit
the Makefile and shell scripts to point to the location of your javac and
java programs, as well as the location where installed SNMP4J.jar and the
log4j jar.
